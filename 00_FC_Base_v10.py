***** Instructions *****

This program will ask you for...
- The name of the product you are selling
- How many items you plan on selling
- The costs for each component of the product
- How much money you want to make

It will then output an itemised list of the costs
with subtotals for the variable and fixed costs.
Finally it will tell you how much you should sell
each item for to reach your profit goal.

This data will also be written to a text file which has the same name as your product.
